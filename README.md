# Object Oriented Programming
## Class Repo
This is all the work that went into The Object Oriented Programming Class I took at Colorado Mesa university. Inside is Classwork that was conducted by the professor and the Homework that was essentially all the projects and final. Each Assignment is listed 1 1 through 5 in order of assignment.
### ClassWork
> This is all the work in class done, after a while of copying code I found it easier to learn if i just watched and then re-read each post on the github later that day. Some of the work is there that i copied in class, none if it is my own code.
### Homework
> This is every assignment including the final. each has a name and should have a README.md description page.
