# ObjectClass
This is where all of my object Oriented classwork and homework will go, for my main object homework it will be located in the homework folder, the classnotes and classwork will be located in the classwork folder, most likely the programs will be written primarily by Warren Macevoy for Classwork however all homwork objects will be of my own creation.
