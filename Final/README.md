# The Factory

## Attempt C++
My first attempt at this was to go off of examples taught in class and use the factory pattern in CPP, however after weeks of work and energy, i was unable to even have a single victory over this behemoth of a pattern. Finally after hours of work, i decided to switch languages to python, something i have had more object work with in the past.

## Python Abstract Factory
Python was simple and fast, what took 14+ pages of code in C++ i was able to create in less than 80 lines of code, in Python. The work was quick and because of the amount of work C++ required, I was a near expert on the pattern. And so the main.py is what i have to show for the abstract factory pattern.
